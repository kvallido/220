You skim the shelf for something interesting. : Stare blankly at the shelf = 8 | Pull out a book about cats = 10 | Return to your table. = 14
You follow him to a bookshelf that covers the span of the whole wall. He skims the shelf for a book. : Tell him to hurry up! = 15 | Wait and see what happens next. = 10
Suddenly you are being rotated as the bookshelf flips you into a secret room! The room is pitch black. : Panic!!!! = 11 | Stand completely still = 12
You hear what sounds like claws repeatedly ripping through carpet. : Panic!!!!! = 11 | Stand completely still. = 12

You enjoy each others presence and all of your anxieties melt away. : Go home. = 16 | Make this your home. = 18
You couldn't have asked for a more relaxing afternoon. : Go home. = 16 | Give that bookshelf a go. = 8
The barista (and also I) will have none of your sass today. : You need to check that attitude, and also you're kicked out = -1
You roll down the windows and play your favorite song the whole way home. : You realize nothing can bring you down & life is good. = -2
The barista is nowhere to be found and there is no exit or allergy medicine in site. : So this is how it ends huh... = -1
You wake up to the warmth of the sun shining onto you through your window. : Was it all just a dream? = -2
